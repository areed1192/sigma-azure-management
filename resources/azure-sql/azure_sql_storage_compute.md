# Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance service tiers

Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance are based on SQL Server database engine
architecture that's adjusted for the cloud environment to ensure 99.99 percent availability,
even if there is an infrastructure failure. Two service tiers are used by Azure SQL Database and
Azure SQL Managed Instance, each with a different architectural model. These service tiers are:

- **General purpose**, which is designed for budget-oriented workloads.
- **Business critical**, which is designed for low-latency workloads with high resiliency to
  failures and fast failovers.

Azure SQL Database has an additional service tier:

- **Hyperscale**, which is designed for most business workloads, providing highly scalable storage,
  read scale-out, and fast database restore capabilities.

This article discusses differences between the service tiers, storage and backup considerations for the
general purpose and business critical service tiers in the vCore-based purchasing model.

## Service tier comparison

The following table describes the key differences between service tiers for the latest generation (Gen5).
Note that service tier characteristics might be different in SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance.
